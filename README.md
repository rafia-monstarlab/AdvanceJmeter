# AdvanceJmeter

I have tried in GUI mode and Non-GUI mode as well. On both mode, I achieved around 30 hits/sec where the reponse time is less than 2 seconds.
So, in this situation i guess there is no need to move to EC2 for this requirement since it's possible to achieve the targted requirements for this
scenario.
